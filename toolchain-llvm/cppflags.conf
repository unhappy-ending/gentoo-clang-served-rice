# C pre-processor flags. These flags are used when Clang translates macros
# during the pre-processing stage. Flags prefixed with -D define macros. To
# undefine macros during this phase, prefix the flag with -U instead.

# -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE
#
#  FORTIFY_SOURCE provides light weight compile and runtime protection to some
#  memory and string functions. It's supposed to have little to no runtime
#  overhead and can be enabled for all applications and libraries in an OS.
#
#  -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE is the default option. If you don't want the overhead use
#  this flag at the cost of some security.

CPPFLAGS="-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE"
